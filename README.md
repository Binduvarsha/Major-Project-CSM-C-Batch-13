## üéØOverview
**AI-Based Video Insights Generator** As video content continues to dominate digital platforms, there is an increasing need for innovative tools
that enhance how users interact with and extract information from videos. The AI-Based Video Insights
Generator takes video analysis a step further by incorporating not only automated text summarization and
theme detection but also advanced features like transcript generation, timestamp creation, voice-based
multilingual summaries, and question-answering support.
The system uses state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to provide an
all-encompassing solution for video insight generation. The Timestamp Generation feature accurately
identifies and marks key moments or sections within the video, allowing users to quickly navigate to
relevant points. Transcript Generation automatically converts speech from videos into text, providing a
written record that can be used for reference, accessibility, or further analysis.
To cater to a global audience, the system supports Multilingual Transcript and Voice Summary
Generation. Users can generate video summaries in both text and voice formats, available in multiple
languages. This is particularly valuable for non-native speakers, making video content more accessible.
Voice-based summaries are generated using natural language processing (NLP) models, ensuring that the
summary captures the key points of the video in a natural and coherent manner across different languages.
The Question-Answering feature allows users to ask questions based on the video and receive accurate
results, which saves the time of watching the complete video.

## üåü Key Features
1. Timestamp Generation: Accurately identifies and marks key moments or sections in the video
and gives clickable links to the parts of the video for easy navigation.
2. Transcript Generation: Converts speech from videos into text, providing a written record for
reference, accessibility, or further analysis.
3. Multilingual Transcript: Supports the generation of transcripts in multiple languages to cater to
a global audience.
4. Voice & text Summary Generation: Summarizes the video content in both text and voice
formats in various languages.
5. Multilingual Summaries: Provides summaries in multiple languages for non-native speakers.
6. Question-Answering Support: Allows users to ask questions from the video and get accurate
responses without watching the entire content.
7. Multiple Video source support: Support various video formats and sources, including YouTube
links, Google Drive links, Dropbox links, and more. This allows users to seamlessly upload and
analyze videos from different platforms without the need for conversion, ensuring greater
flexibility and accessibility for all types of video content.
8. Theme Detection: Theme detection automatically identifies and categorizes the central topics or
themes within a video by analyzing speech, visual elements, and context, allowing users to
quickly understand the main subjects without watching the entire content
